# Movie-recommendation-system

**Theory outline**

Collect and preprocess the data: You will need a dataset of user interactions with items (such as products or articles). This could include ratings, views, or purchases. You will then need to preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling. This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and filtering out irrelevant information.

Choose a recommendation algorithm: There are several algorithms that can be used to build a recommendation system, including collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and content-based filtering. You will need to decide which algorithm is most appropriate for your dataset and use case.

Train the model: Once you have chosen an algorithm, you will need to train a model using your dataset. This will involve splitting the data into training and test sets and using the training set to fit the model. You may also need to tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

Evaluate the model: After training the model, you will need to evaluate its performance using the test set. You can use metrics such as precision, recall, and mean squared error to assess the model's accuracy.

Make recommendations: Once you have a trained and evaluated model, you can use it to make recommendations to users. You can do this by predicting the ratings or preferences that a user is likely to give to a particular item and recommending the top-rated items.

Deploy the model: Finally, you will need to deploy the model so that it can be used to make recommendations in a production environment. This may involve integrating the model into a web application or a recommendation engine service.

**About the code**

This code reads in a CSV file of user ratings for movies, creates a pivot table of users and movies, and converts the pivot table to a sparse matrix. It then creates a NearestNeighbors model and fits it to the matrix. The recommend function uses the model to find the nearest neighbors of a given user and returns a list of movie recommendations based on the ratings of those neighbors. The function can then be tested by calling it with a user ID and the number of recommendations desired.
